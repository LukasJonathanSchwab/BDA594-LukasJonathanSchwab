When I had to define Big Data I would say:
Today the importance of tracking data ist growing in a fast way. It's possible to track a lot of data in the different segments. Tracking data is important in the e-commerce, automotive sector, public live in general and in a lot more segments. The get some insights and a competitive advantage (for example in the e-commerce market) the important thing is not to track the data, the important point is to analyze the data in the right way. We need to analyze the data to get insights into the data, to find patterns and to learn out of the data. Because these data are so huge it is not possible to analyze the data manually. The right way to analyze these data is to use ML algorithms.
